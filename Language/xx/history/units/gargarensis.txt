Gargarensis is a cyclops and a distant descendant of Poseidon. His great-grandmother, Amymone, was seduced by Poseidon for which Gargarensis has never forgiven him. Rather than try to exact revenge against the sea god, the cyclops figures Poseidon owes him. He wants nothing more than to be a god himself and will stop at nothing to achieve this.
