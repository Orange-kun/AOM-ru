The first and most persistent barriers against opponents throughout history have been earthen ramparts. Rammed-earth walls first appear in China in the Neolithic period, ca. 5000 BC, and its virtues as a fireproof, quake-resistant building material with good insulating capabilities made earthen walls an excellent choice of building material for both civilian and military applications.

The Yellow Emperor Huangdi is credited with building the very first city wall. During the Shang dynasty walls might ascend to a height of 20 meters, or 65 feet, as found at the city of Ao (1400 BC). The city of Handan in the state of Zhou (386 BC) had walls of similar dimensions, showing how city walls and layouts only became more uniform as Imperial China grew and consolidated its power.

At the "Long Wall," the series of fortifications built by the Warring States to defend their own borders, walls were constructed by ramming earth and gravel between wooden boards. They could withstand typical attacks from troops wielding small-arms, but would be ineffective against later siege engines and protracted siege warfare. After consolidating his new empire, in 221 BC the Emperor Zheng of Qin demolished the parts of the Long Wall which divided his states, and restored, combined, and expanded what remained in the north into the Great Wall of China.
