Nü Wa is the sister and wife of Fu Xi, and daughter of Hua Hsu, a primordial being created by the death of Pangu. In the early days of creation she fashioned the upper classes of mankind from the mud of the Yellow River, then dipped her veil in the water and whirled it around her head, scattering the droplets. Each drop became a member of the peasantry, and thus was mankind born.
