Chongli or Zhurong is a god of fire and warfare, who rides a giant tiger into battle. He has a son, Gong Gong, a sea monster and troublemaker.

Gong Gong once plotted to take the throne of heaven from Shangdi, and Chongli his father donned his armor and mounted his war tiger to stop him. He and Gong Gong dueled for many days in the heavens, and finally Chongli smote his son down to Earth. Furious at his loss, Gong Gong bashed his head against the pillars which held the earth in place, and Nü Wa had to fix the world with the help of the great turtle Ao. Chongli, victorious, ascended back to heaven as the god of fire and Lord of the South.
