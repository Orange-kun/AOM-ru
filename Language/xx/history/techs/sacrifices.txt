Some of the best and earliest evidence of ritual sacrifice in Chinese cultural context comes from Shang oracle bones, usually from oxen or tortoises. The bones of the sacrificed creatures were burned and read by priests, who provided immediate interpretation of the effectiveness of the sacrifice, positive or negative. Evidence for human sacrifice is also common, particularly to river deities like He Bo. In a few instances millet, wine, and gold are also found in sacrificial contexts. These sacrifices were meant to inspire favor from gods and spirits on behalf of the petitioner, or to seek guidance and advice on current and future problems.
