Sun Wukong is the fabled Monkey King, made most famous for his role in "Journey to the West," where he makes friends and foes among all the gods of China in his many adventures.

One time Sun Wukong visited Ao Kuang, Dragon King of the Eastern Sea. The Monkey King sought to find a weapon that he could wield from among the great dragon's many treasures. To Ao Kuang's frustration, the Monkey King broke any weapon the dragon gave him to try. Finally Sun Wukong reached Ruyi Jingu Bang, the pillar once used by Yu the Great to measure the seas, and which now held them in their place and which controlled the oceans' tides. Ao Kuang thought it would be too heavy for him to lift, but the rod obediently changed its size and leapt into his hands, plunging the oceans into chaos. Fearful of Sun Wukong's power, the Dragon King gave him many more magical items from his treasury to placate him.

The Monkey King has the power to pluck hairs from his body, and each hair becomes a copy of himself, strength, skill, weapons, and all. This allows him to assemble vast, unstoppable forces on a whim.
