NÃ¼ Wa raises your fallen peasants from the dead with the gift of new water droplets from her hair. She sculpts your villagers anew from the wet clay of the earth.

To use Recreation, left-click the icon at the top of the screen, then left-click over the corpses of the villagers you wish to be resurrected. Be aware that if the corpse has rotted away, you have lost your chance to raise it back from the dead.
