Dabo Gong is also known as Tu Di Gong, and is the god of soil and land. He is traditionally venerated as a part of burial rituals, and his reputation for granting blessings has earned him the formal name of Fudegong, the lord of blessing and virtue.

It was once thought by the other gods that Dabo Gong was too free with his gifts and blessings upon the mortals, and they complained to the Jade Emperor. The Jade Emperor decided that the best solution would be to give him a wife who could look over his shoulder and make sure that he was dispersing gifts judiciously. So he found a girl who had been wrongfully accused of a crime and took her to heaven to become Tu Di Po, the wife of Dabo Gong who carefully restrains him from being too generous with his blessings.
