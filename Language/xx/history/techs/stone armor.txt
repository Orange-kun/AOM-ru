Huangdi's Terracotta Army featured over 8000 soldiers, each with their own weapons and armor. Although many weapons were looted after the excavation or simply rotted away over time, the more durable ones are still around. Weapons containing iron or copper alloys have been preserved, as well as stone armor suits, which were found on some of the clay soldiers.
