He Bo, also known as Bingyi, is god of the great Yellow River. He is described in his true form as a fish with the head of a man, But he can transform into other creatures. He often rides around in a chariot pulled by dragons.

One day He Bo decided to transform into a great white dragon and roam around the earth for a day. However, midway through his travels he came upon Houyi the Archer, who shot him in the eye. He Bo complained to Shangdi and cried for vengeance, but the god would hear none of it. "If you had been carrying out your godly duties, how would you have been shot? If you were running around like a beast, then Houyi acted properly shooting at you."
