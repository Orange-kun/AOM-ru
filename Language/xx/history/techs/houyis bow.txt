Houyi was a Chinese archer, sometimes portrayed as the God of Archery. He was married to Chang'e until she drank his Elixir of Immortality. Houyi was hailed as a hero for humanity for his bravery and great skill when he shot down nine out of ten sunbirds, offsprings of Di Jun, after their misdeeds, which nearly scorched the Earth. His heroic actions restored balance to the rising and setting of the sun, but also caused him to create enemies.
