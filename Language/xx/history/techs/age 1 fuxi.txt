Fu Xi is the husband and brother of Nüwa, and son of Hua Hsu, a primordial being created by the death of Pangu. He taught mankind how to live on earth; how to fish, hunt, and cook. He laid down mankind's laws, and instituted marriage between man and women.

In the early days of mankind, humans were in a state of chaos after their creation. They did not know how to clean their food, they ate hair, bone, and blood, and threw away leftovers without a mind for the future. They looked up to heaven, and Fu Xi took pity on them. He came down and gave them laws and civilization, and elevated them above the beasts.
