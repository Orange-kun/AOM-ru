The stirrup is a small ring or platform, usually metal, suspended from either side of the saddle of a horse. It allows the rider to plant his feet while riding in the saddle. Stirrups in China can be dated reliably in sculpture to the Jin dynasty, ca. 320 AD, and were certainly widespread by the next century. The stirrup allows riders a stable platform from which to use weapons such as swords and maces, particularly against foes on the ground such as infantry. The ability to stand in the saddle allows for greater freedom of movement while wielding these weapons, and greatly increases the efficacy of shock-cavalry tactics.
