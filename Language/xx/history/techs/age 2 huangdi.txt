Huangdi is known by many names and titles, including Yu Huang Shangdi, the Yellow Emperor, and the Jade Emperor. He is the lord of deities and guardian of heaven.

He began as an apprentice to Yuanshi Tianzun, the original and primordial god of heaven, who at the beginning of each age gives his students the Scriptures of the Magic Jewel and instructs them in Taoism from his home on Mount Kunlun. Huangdi left, seeking isolation to cultivate his Tao, and overcame 3,200 trials over the course of 200 million years. When he returned, a powerful demon who had overcome 3,000 trials of his own was on the cusp of victory over all the other gods of heaven, and Huangdi alone was powerful enough to finally defeat him. For this great victory he was given his many titles, and proclaimed supreme ruler of heaven.
