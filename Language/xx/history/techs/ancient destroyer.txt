The fire-god Chongli defeated his son, the water-dragon Gong Gong, in no small part because Chongli was mounted atop his black battle tiger. The tiger is the King of Beasts, and the eternal opponent of dragons like Gong Gong. Chongli grants your destroyers the speed of his tiger to aid in your own water battles.
