The Great Wall of China originally began as a series of separate fortifications that were later joined and further improved. Their main purpose was to protect the states of China against nomadic raids and invasions from the Eurasian Steppe. As the walls were made of various materials including stone, brick, wood, and earth, and had to withstand both the test of time and numerous hostilities, the Great Wall had to continue to be rebuilt and enhanced for centuries.
