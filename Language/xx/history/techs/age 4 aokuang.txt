The dragon Ao Kuang is Lord of the Eastern Sea. His three brothers, Ao Qin, Ao Run, and Ao Shun rule the seas of the other cardinal directions. He and his brothers are fickle rulers, and Ao Kuang's many ill-reputed sons cause their share of mayhem on earth. Over time this built him a following of fearful subjects eager to appease him. He maintains a vast collection of heavenly weapons and artifacts in his grand undersea palace.

Ao Kuang's reputation made him many enemies, perhaps the most notable of which was Nezha, son of the military commander Li Jing. When Ao Kuang demanded a sacrifice of children to eat, Nezha beat off his minions and killed the Dragon King's third son, Ao Bing. Ao Kuang fled to the Jade Emperor's court to plead for vengeance, but Nezha followed him there and beat him severely, ripping off scales and drawing blood. Ao Kuang then took Li Jing and his wife hostage in exchange for Nehza's life, and Nezha committed suicide to placate the dragon.
