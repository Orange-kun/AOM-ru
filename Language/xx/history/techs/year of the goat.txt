Fu Xi sends a herd of Goats to his followers. They can be sent anywhere on the map. The God Power provides more Goats the later you use it: 3 in the Archaic Age, 6 in the Classical Age, 9 in the Heroic Age, and 12 in the Mythic Age.

To use Year of the Goat, select the icon at the top of the screen, then select a location on the map where you want to create the herd.
