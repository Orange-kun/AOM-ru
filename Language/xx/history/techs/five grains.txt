The Five Grains are a group of five farmed crops that were very important in the agriculture of ancient China. These crops were deemed sacred and their cultivation supernatural, even mythological. Which crops exactly belong to this sacred group remains unclear. However, Confucius lists them as soybeans, wheat, broomcorn, foxtail millet, and hemp. Huangdi gave the wisdom of the Five Grains to the people of China.
