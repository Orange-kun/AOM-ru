Since the belief in an afterlife was present throughout many dynasties, the burial practices in ancient China largely stood on two main principles: The first was a ritual ceremony, the size of which could be tremendous especially when involving the burial of an emperor. The second principle lay in the practice of placing the deceased one's favourite objects and wealth in the tomb with them, for it was strongly maintained that they would need these items with them in the next world. A grandiose example of this practice can be seen in the tomb of the first emperor of China, Huangdi, who was buried with a terracotta army of over eight thousand men.
