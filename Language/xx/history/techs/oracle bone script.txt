The Oracle Bone Script is believed to be the first Chinese character writing system. It was created by Cangjie, a legendary four-eyed historian at the court of Huangdi, the Yellow Emperor. After the unification of China, Huangdi was no longer content with the 'rope knot tying' method to store information, and he assigned Cangjie the task of creating a new character system. After long days of unsuccessful attempts to complete the task, Cangjie suddenly spotted a Phoenix flying overhead, carrying something in its beak. The object fell to the ground and left an impression of a hoof print. Cangjie could not recognize the hoof print and asked a hunter, who had told him it was from a Pixiu, as no other animal was alike. This inspired Cangjie to create characters that capture all things on Earth with their most defining features and he soon completed the task. The Emperor was delighted with Cangjie's work and the new writing system was quickly adopted.
