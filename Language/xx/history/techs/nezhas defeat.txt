Ao Kuang's reputation made him many enemies, perhaps the most notable of which was Nezha, son of the military commander Li Jing. When Ao Kuang demanded a sacrifice of children to eat, Nezha beat off his minions and killed the Dragon King's third son, Ao Bing. Ao Kuang fled to the Jade Emperor's court to plead for vengeance, but Nezha followed him there and beat him severely, ripping off scales and drawing blood. Ao Kuang then took Li Jing and his wife hostage in exchange for Nehza's life, and Nezha committed suicide to placate the dragon.
