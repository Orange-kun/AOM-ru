Ao Kuang, Dragon Lord of the Eastern Sea was once notorious for his temper, and the Fengshen Yanyi tells stories of the disasters he caused to inspire fear in his subjects. If he was slighted by any of the villages and cities within reach of the coast, or if they refused to submit to his rule, he would not hesitate to send a great flood to wipe them off the face of the earth. The fear he inspired was so great that no one ever complained to Huangdi about his actions, lest the great dragon take vengeance.

It was only after the death of his son Ao Bixi and his own defeat at the hands of Nezha that Ao Kuang adopted a more aloof lifestyle, even though he won against Nezha in the end by forcing the god to sacrifice himself for his family. He now uses his powers more judiciously, lest another being of such power take him by surprise.
