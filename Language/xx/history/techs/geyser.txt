Geyser is a powerful rush of water that spurts out of the Earth and devours the enemy. It can be unleashed at will by He Bo, the Lord of the River, when he is appeased and sufficiently worshiped. While Geyser can be a deadly weapon, the price to pay for it is often costly.

Desperately trying to get into He Bo's good graces, people would worship the cruel god with human sacrifices, particularly those of female virgins that were offered to He Bo as brides. The girls were ceremonially prepared for several days and subsequently sent floating on a raft on the God's raging river until they sank.
